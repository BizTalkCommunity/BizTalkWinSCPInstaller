SYNTAX
    InstallWinSCPForBizTalk-v7.ps1 [[-nugetDownloadFolder] <String>] [-ForceInstall] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Determining which WinSCP version to install depends on your current version of
    Microsoft BizTalk Server 2016 or 2020 you have 
    which Cumulative Update and Feature Pack/Update you have installed.
    Making sure that you have the right version has been historically difficult.
    This script detects the version of the the most recent Cumulative Update
    and Feature Pack and then downloads NuGet; gets the right version of WinSCP
    using NuGet; and then finally copies WinSCP to 
    the Microsoft BizTalk Server installation folder.
    The user must have write access to the Microsoft BizTalk Server 
    installation folder and the temporary folder used during 
    the process, which implies should be running under 
    an administrative PowerShell session.
    By default, the user's TEMP folder  is used, and a subfolder 'nuget' 
    is created below that and used to store the temporary files.
    
    NOTE: This script does not delete the temporary folder after use.
    
    If the correct version of WinSCP is already installed in the BizTalk
    directory, then the script detects the installation and does nothing.
    
    This script supports the -WhatIf parameter to show what 
    would happen but makes no changes to the system.
    
    This script supports a -ForceInstall parameter that overrides the
    WinSCP detection and installs even if the correct WinSCP version
    is installed.
    
    PRODUCTION USE
    This script is designed to be used in a production environment
    when the system does not have access to the internet.
    During testing you will run this script on a system that has
    the same version and cumulative update versions as production.
    Specify the output folder using the -nugetDownloadFolder.
    
    Copy the output folder to production and run the script with
    the -nugetDownloadFolder setting pointing to the folder.
    
    The script will detect that the folder contains NuGet and WinSCP
    in the folder and will not attempt to go to the internet
    to download WinSCP.
    Instead, the script will use the existing files and copy them to
    the Microsoft BizTalk Server installation folder.
    

PARAMETERS
    -nugetDownloadFolder <String>
        nugetDownloadFolder is the temporary folder that will be used 
        to save the NuGet program and the WinSCP components 
        during download.
        This folder is not deleted after the script finishes.
